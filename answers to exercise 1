Exercise 1
It makes the Divs skinnier
They both float all the way right but are under each other
The same thing happens but to the left
Everything resizes smaller and eventually the Divs end up next to each other
There is a large space in between the Divs
The divs are both to the left and are very long stretching across the whole screen one underneath the other

The Divs now adjust so that they continue to stay within their percentage of the browser

They were all set to 30% and fit evenly
The first Div is set to 25% and the following are set to 35%. Div1 is longer and skinnier than the other 2
